Invy is an app that helps small retail companies keep track of shipping, product inventory, sales, and purchasing

Depending on their assigned roles, users have CRUD abilities for inventory products, orders, supplier profiles, category & subcategory management, and user profiles. Admins have full CRUD permissions, Managers have slightly fewer, and Staff have the least.

The app will eventually be able to accept barcode scanning inputs to further automate inventory management processes like sales, restocks, and audits.

More features to come:
Ingestion of external transaction/shipping information
Connectivity with a payment platform
Analytics for financial and inventory information
