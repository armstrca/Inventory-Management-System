This is a relatively bare-bones app that helps retail companies keep track of shipping, product inventory, and existing orders.

Depending on their assigned roles, users have CRUD abilities for inventory products, transactions, orders, supplier profiles, category & subcategory management, and user profiles. Admins have full CRUD permissions, Managers have slightly fewer, and Staff have the least.

Theoretically the app could eventually be connected to an online sales platform or receive input from a barcode scanner to process transactions in real-time.
